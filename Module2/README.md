# Overview

Tetris is a puzzle video game using Java. Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

One of the main purposes of Tetris according to brain imaging is to promote a thicker cortex and it can also increase the efficiency of the brain.

The goal of the game is to prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen for as long as possible. Subsequent versions of the game included different modes of play and unique twists.

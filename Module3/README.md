# Overview

The goal of the game is use the random function to generate the random integer that the player will try to guess. Also, the user defines how much money to use in their bets.

# Development Environment

* C++ is a popular programming language. 
* The variable that stores the address of another variable (like foo in the previous example) is what in C++ is called a pointer. Pointers are a very powerful feature of the language that has many uses in lower level programming. A bit later, we will see how to declare and use pointers.
* Epointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware. 
* C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes"

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:
* Include score.
* Include the way to down the images with the typer.
* Improves accuracy of the graphics.

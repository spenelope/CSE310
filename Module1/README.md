# Overview

The main objective of this project is to apply my knowledge of Python. I used in this project the Turtle library. Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that allows users to create images and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.

The purpose of this project is to cross without being hit by an obstacle. The game has different functionalities as the obstacles are of different colors and change their location. Also, the more levels the player progresses, obstacles increase their speed.

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:
